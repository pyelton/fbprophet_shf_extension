# fbprophet_shf_extension

This repo extends the usability of the fbprophet module (from Facebook) for forecasting models so that the diagnostics.py script can do time series cross validation (simulated historical forecasts) on any type of model set up in the scikitlearn fashion (with fit and predict functions). It also plots cross validated models over time.
